Project for Rackspace job application. Created this project based on angular-seed repo, but I removed a lot of the stuff I did not need though. Needs NodeJS installed to build and run locally. Run 'npm start' to install dependencies and go to http://localhost:8000/index.html to see the app locally. Run 'npm test' to run unit tests.
